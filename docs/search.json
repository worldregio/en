    "text": "Where is Europe?\n\n\nWorldRegio project aims to revisit, from a theoretical and empirical point of view, one of the most fundamental and oldest problems in geography: regionalization. We would like to develop a general theory of the regionalization of a world (abstractly) and then apply it to the trajectories of regionalization of the World (concretely) through time and space. Although rooted in geography, economy, and regional science, this project calls for a dialogue with many other disciplines.\nIn common usage, the term region refers to a portion of space on an intermediate scale between the local and national levels. A regionalization is a division corresponding to the first level of social, spatial, and political organization used below the state. But what about regionalizations of the World, which correspond to a division on an intermediate scale below the global level but above the national level? Faced with a plurality of powers and languages, they are often the source of conflicts of representation or even world wars.\nThe theoretical part of the project aims to understand the difficulties of regionalization of abstract worlds. Different geometries lead to different delimitations of the boundaries of regions, while different languages lead to different semantic qualifications of the content of these regions. Representation conflicts are inevitable if methods are not used to align geometric and semantic concepts.\nApplied to the dynamics of the contemporary world over 20 to 50 years, the empirical part of the project aims to explore the trajectories of regionalization that are transforming the material and imaginary organization of the World. The project proposes to analyze the transformations that are affecting the functional regionalization of the world (trade flows), the imaginaries produced by the media (news flow), and the cognitive representation that actors use according to their social and spatial position (mental maps).\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{grasland2024,\n  author = {Grasland, Claude},\n  title = {WorldRegio},\n  date = {2024-08-31},\n  url = {https://worldregio.github.io/en/posts/2024-08-31-worldregio/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGrasland, Claude. 2024. “WorldRegio.” August 31, 2024. https://worldregio.github.io/en/posts/2024-08-31-worldregio/."

    "text": "Summary\n\nIn this paper, we will investigate whether or not the name ‘Africa’ can be seen as a slur. Since the name was given by European exploiters, slavers and colonists, it raises the question of whether such a name should continue to be accepted or abandoned. It may seem that just as the slavers renamed their victims and the colonists renamed the territories they conquered, the name Africa/ns similarly was an imposition on the continent and its peoples. It can also be argued that the naming of the continent by an external aggressor is a form of epistemic subordination that vitiates the dignity of the inhabitants. That is to say that European slavers took it upon themselves to give the inhabitants an identity that highlights climate and possibly skin colour because it was something they could not do for themselves. This presents the inhabitants as inferior to their namers and whose millennia-old civilisational achievements can comfortably be overlooked. We argue that the two preceding arguments constitute compelling reasons to abandon the name Africa as a compromised identity and offer an idea for the renaming of the continent."

Ramose (2003) is the authors’ main reference for criticizing the origin of the word “Africa” and its assignment by Europeans to peoples who had not claimed it. Even if the etymology of the word is debated, it seems to designate “a warm place” (in relation to whom?) whose inhabitants would therefore have “black” skin, the whole constituting a racialized, even slave vision.\n\nIn other words, “the history of ‘Africa’ is primarily the history of the West European experience of ‘Africa’, and only secondarily the history of the continent’s peoples about themselves”. This idea is echoed by Grataloup when he shows that it was Europeans who taught the inhabitants of the southern Mediterranean that they lived on a continent called “Africa” (Grataloup (2009),Grataloup (2011),Grataloup and Capdepuy (2013),Capdepuy (2024)), or in Bopda (2003)’s work on the construction of Cameroon’s national identity."

    "section": "Why rename?",
    "text": "Why rename?\nThe authors identify several arguments in favor of a name change. The two main ones are as follows: -\n\nThe definition of Africa by climate is a historical denial : The authors point out that “by pointing at climate, the European namer silences the history and civilisations of the people. It is as if those people do not exist. The climate-driven name ‘Africa’ can amount to a denial of the people, their existence and contributions to world history and civilisation. This supports our argument that ‘Africa’ can be viewed as a slur, especially in this age of racism, and that the imposition of the name on the continent by Europeans can be interpreted as a form of epistemic subordination of the inhabitants and their cultures.” It’s hard not to recall the unfortunate statement made by a French president in Dakar in 2007, when he declared that “Africa’s tragedy is that the African man has not enough enter in history”1.\nThe right of peoples to self-determination of their name exists at the national level, and must also apply at the continental level: “If we add to the above our earlier discussion on the metaphysical and psychological import of naming, then we would observe that the European naming of a continent and its peoples is an anomaly. No continent or people should have the right to name another. If, for any reason at all, people have been named by another in the past, it is their duty to rename themselves. And this should apply not just to the continent but to countries as well.”. The authors review the countries that have changed their colonial names, such as Rodesia, and criticize those that have not, such as Côte d’Ivoire."

    "text": "Anaesia : Land of origins\nThe authors end the article by proposing the word Anaesia from the Ibo language: “Here, we want to propose the name ‘Anaesia’ as a veritable replacement derived from ‘ana and esi’, two words in Igbo-African language that mean ’land or place of origin.’Footnote10 Our case for the abandonment of the name Africa and its replacement with Anaesia is based on two arguments: dignity and epistemic subordination.” The idea is to put Africa back on the map as the “first continent” from which all peoples and civilizations originate, and thus to refute the idea of subordination contained in the word Africa, as well as all the climatic or racial undertones it carried.\nNevertheless, the authors acknowledge some difficulties in choosing the language used to describe this “Land of Origins”. Why choose the Ibo language (the language of Nigeria, from which one of the authors of the article originates) rather than another of the many African languages? The authors dodge the question with what can only be called a pirouette: “Some objections could be raised against our proposal here. Some may question why the entire continent should be named from one of its multiple languages given that the Igbo language is not Africa’s lingua franca. As a result, they may question the possibility of the rest of the continent accessing the Igbo world and the name Anaesia. Others may question our authority to propose a new name for the entire continent. These are legitimate concerns. However, it is important for us to realise that what we are doing is exercise of scholars’ poetic license.”."

    "section": "Data",
    "text": "Data\nThe data used in our analysis has been extracted from the website of the Pew Research Center where they can be freely downloaded. They are more precisely extraction from the Pew Global Attitude Survey from 2002 to present (2023). From 2002 to 2023, 22 waves of the PGAS has been realized and the majority of questions has changed over time or have been formulated in a different way, which make comparisons difficult. We have therefore selected a very limited number of questions which has kept exactly the same wording over time and has been asked in different waves.\n\nThe opinion on world powers\nWe will focus here on the question related to opinion of people about the USA and other major states and international organisations in the world. This question is more complex because it is a battery of questions about different countries but also sometimes different people, different organisation or even different religions. The general rule is to start by the question about the opinion of USA (and eventually “Americans”) and then to propose the other items in a random order. It suggest that USA/Americans are used as a reference around which we can measure positive or negative deviations. Another important complication with this question is the fact that some items are proposed to all countries under investigation but other are only asked in selected countries. In this case, we are oblige to admit that the comparison will be biased because the full list of items has a systemic influence on the results about each item. As an example, consider the formulation of the question in the waves of 2009 an 2019.\n\n\n\nQuestion on opinion about countries in 2009\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion on opinion about countries in 2019\n\n\nThe wording of the question is the same and the ordinal scale at four level is equivalent, but the fact that the list of items has changed introduce a difficulty in the analysis of the results, even if we decide to focus only the items that are present in the two waves (USA, China, Russia, EU, UN). In 2009, the evaluation is influenced by questions about religions which is not the case in 2019. Even if we consider a single year like 2019, the fact that NATO or Germany are added to the items in Europe but not in other countries of the world will probably modify the answers about Russia. Considering the difficulties induced by the halo effect, we have decided to limit our selection of answers to the items that (1) has been asked to all countries and (2) the item that are about states or regional organization but not about peoples or religions. In the following analysis, we limit our analysis to USA, China, Russia and EU that are the item that has been themost frequently asked.\n\n\nSpatial coverage\nThere is a great variability in the list and number of states that was investigated by the PGAS. Generally speaking the number of states investigated was more important for the odd-numbered years with a larger extension toward developping countries from the South. The even-numberd years was generally characterised by a lower number of countries and a focus on rich countries from the North. But they are many exceptions to this rule.\n\nThe countries that has been the most present in the 22 waves are members of “the Western” (Germany, France, UK, Spain, Japan, Poland) and can be considered as “friends” of the US. The US themselves has not been investogated in the final period 2021-2023, probably because the questions asked in PGAS are also asked in other national surveys of the Pew Research Center (PRC). It is certainly possible to find the data for these years elsewhere on the website of the PRC.\nRussia has been systematically investigated from 2002 to 2015 but not in 2016. Then present again in 2017-2019 but not after. We can imagine that the possibility to realize surveys in Russia became more difficult after the first war of Ukraine (2014) and impossible with the beginning of the Covid crisis (2020)\nChina was investigated in 2002 and in 2005-2016 but never after this period of time. As in the case of Russia, we can imagine that it became difficult and finally impossible to realize surveys in these country after the designation of Xi Jiping as head of state in 2013.\nIn the ‘South’, the coverage is much more important for large emerging countries (Indian Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, …) than smaller one.\nAfrica is less covered than Middle-East\netc.\n\nFrom statistical point of view we should just keep in the moment that the survey has been realized at least one time in 70 countries of the world. But only a minority of them are likely to be used for the analysis of trends over long period of time.\n\n\n\nSpatial coverage of the global attitude survey (2002-2023)\n\n\nLooking at the map, it appears very clearly an uneven spatial distribution with very spare coverage in Africa or central Asia as compared to Americas, Europa and Southern or Eastern Asia. The PGAS will therefore not offer a perfect basis for the analysis of the evolution of global opinion in the world. But it makes nevertheless possible to explore some great tendencies in all part of the world between 2002 and 2023.\n\n\nMultidimensional array\nIn order to have a better formalisation of the data, we will transform the database in a multidimensional structure where each opinion will be describe by a single variable \\(O_{ijt}\\) where :\n\n\\(O\\) is an opinion measured on a Likert scale with 4 levels (“Very favorable”, “Almost favorable”, “Almost unfavorable”,“Very Unfavorable”)\n\\(i\\) is the origin of the opinion (i.e. the place of survey where the opinion has been collected)\n\\(j\\) is the target of the opinion (i.e. the country or organisation that was evaluated). We limit here the value to three case that are USA, China and Russia.\n\\(t\\) the time period (i.e. wave of survey) of collection of the opinion.\n\nThe database is eventually completed by two structural parameter describing the age \\(A_{it}\\) and the sex \\(S_{it}\\) of the person who has formulated the opinion. We can eventually cross the results with another variable \\(R_{it}\\) describing the opinion on religion using another Likert scale with 4 levels.\nLest but not least each sample collected in a country i a t time t is associated with a weigthing criteria \\(W_{it}\\) that insure a better representation of the full population.\nWe transform Oijt in a boolean variable Fijt related to favorable opinion (very favorable or mostly favoable) and we eliminate people without opinion."

What appears clearly in the figure is a recent divergence between US and European Union on the one hand, China and Russia on the other hand. More precisely :\n\nEuropean Union has maintained a good level of appreciation during all the period with apparentlyan increase between 2014 and 2019-23, but difficult to validate because lack of data.\nUSA has experimented a more chaotic trend with ups and downs in relation with the different presidents. But has a whole the general trend appears to be positive during the period.\nChina had initially an excellent position and was the most appreciated world power in 2005-2006 and also 2009-2013. But this favorable appreciation declined regularly and especially in 2020 , probably in relation with the covid crisis.\nRussia has the same appreciation than USA in 2007-2008 and remained stable with just a slow decline in 2015. But the decrease was very strong after 2019 and the lowest level was reached in 2022-23 with the second war in Ukraine.\n\nThis results has to be cautiously interpreted because, despite the fact to control the effect of the places of survey, it remains a strong influence of the selection of countries involved or excluded from the Global Attitude Survey."

    "text": "Classification of survey countries according to world power preferences\nWe can proceed to a second analysis where we try to evaluate the average opinion of survey countries on the four world power during the period of observation 2002-2023. We assume therefore that the hierarchy of opinion of this world power has remained stable over time inside each survey country which is probably not the case. But we expect to reveal some general organisation of the world in regions sharing the same geopolitical attitudes. The logit model used in this case take the form :\n\\(log \\frac{p}{1-p} = \\alpha + \\delta_t.time_t + \\tau_{jt}.[origin\\times target]_{ij}\\)\nWe obtain a table of the parameter \\(\\tau_{jt}\\) with fours columns (one for each power) and as many lines as survey countries. We eliminate the lines corresponding to countries that has not given an opinion about each of the four world powers. We eliminate also USA, Russia and China in order to avoid biases related to self appreciation. This table is then used for the realization of a Principal Component Analysis and a Hierachical Clustering using war crteria.\n\nTwo major dimensions\n We notice that the two first dimension summarize more than 80% of the information and only minor details are collected by dimension three and four.\n\nDim1 reveals a general opinion on the four world powers that can be generally positive (right) or generally negative (left).\nDim2 reveals a polarisation between the ‘Western and the Rest’ or, said differently, between ‘Global North and Global South’. Countries located on the top are more favorable to Russia and China than to the US and EU. Countries on the bottom are characterized by the opposite.\nDim3 characterized specific situations of dissociation between preferences for China and Russia that can for example happen in the case of Vietnam.\nDim4 characterized excpetional cases of dissociation between preferences for US and Europe that can for example happen in the case of UK.\n\nWe can now examine the position of survey countries on these different dimensions. But we can firstly proceed to a hieararchical clustering in order to discuss the position of group of countries rather than single ones. We obtain clearly five group of countries with characteristic profiles.\n\n\nFive types of opinion\n\n\n\nHierachical clustering of survey countries\n\n\n\nCluster 1 is characterized by a very negative opinion about USA and EU and a negative opinion about Russia. Only China is characterized by an average opinion comparable to the rest of the world. The countries member of this cluster are typically arabic countries from Middle East (Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Occupied Palestinian Territories, Turkey)\nCluster 2 is characterized by a positive opinion of EU, a neutral opinon on USA and a very negative opinion of Russia and China. This situation is typically observed in countries member of the EU but rather from western and northern part (France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden) but also other OECD countries (Japan, Korea, Canada, Australia, …)\nCluster 3 is generally characterized by an average profile. More precisely it is characterized by neutral opinion of Russia, slighltly negative opinion on USA, slightly positive opinion on China and more negative opinion on European Union than in the rest of the sample. This situation corresponds to a large cluster of emerging countries located all around the world, including european countries from southern and eastern Europe like (Greece, Slovenia, Czech Republic, …). UK is member of this group as well as Israel.\nCluster 4 is a very specific case of countries having a much more positive opinion on Russia than usual, a rather positive opinion on USA and a rather negative opinion on China. Countries located in this group are european countries with good relations with Russia (Bulgaria, Slovakia) or asian countries characterized by negative relation with China, generally due to border conflicts (India, Vietnam, Philippines).\nCluster 5 is the complete opposite of Cluster 1 and is characterized by very positive opinion about all the world powers without distinction. This situation is typically associated to all countries from sub-saharan Africa present in the surveys (Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Ghana, …) but also some other poor and developping countries (Bangladesh, Nicaragua, Thailand)\n\n\n\nMapping geopolitical proximities\nWe can finally elabore a geopolitical map of countries opinion about the major world power over the period 2002-2023. To do that, we project the clusters on the two first dimensions of PCA and visualize tthe ellipes of dispersion of each group.\n\n\n\nGeoplitical map of world opinion on major powers\n\n\nThe most striking result of the analysis is the fact that many clusters are clearly associated to specific world regions even if they are exceptions to this rule. Further research will try to explain the origin of this regional pattern. Is it just a matter of correlation with hidden variables ? Or are they geographical effects of distance and diffusion of opinion ?"

    "text": "Introduction\nOne of the possible option of the Worldregio project is to propose methods of regionalization based on the division of a network of states into sub-networks (components) according to a dual criteria :\n\ngeometric proximity : the components should fulfill a first condition of proximity in the graph\nattribute proximity : the components should fulfill a condition of similarity, level of interaction, etc. which is supposed to be independent from their geometric proximity.\n\nThe definition of a geopolitical network at world level implies the joint definition of two lists of objects :\n\na finite list of political units called states\na finite list of relations between political units called borders\n\nNotice that states and borders are used here in the abstract sense of edges and vertices which means that they do not necessary fit with the common sense idea.\nThis question of distance between countries has historically been the subject of a great deal of research, notably within the framework of the correlates of war project (cow), a network of political scientists and historians who have tried to understand the causes of wars and conflicts. Among many solutions, the authors often emphasize contiguity, i.e. the presence of a common border:\n\n“Whatever the reason for the findings connecting contiguity and conflict, geographic proximity is clearly important factor for empirical analyses of international relations. Several approaches are based on continuous measures of distance between countries. The distance between national capitals (Gleditsch and Singer 1975), or between centers of power (Bueno de Mesquita 1981 ), have been used to as measures of geographic proximity. Gleditsch and Ward (2001) have begun to construct a data set based on the concept of minimum distance, which is simply the distance between the two closest points for a pair of states. Nevertheless, direct contiguity is relatively straightforward and has therefore been, by far, the most common way of measuring proximity.”(Stinnett et al. 2002).\n\nThis is the solution we’re going to adopt here, in an attempt to update the database produced by these authors in the early 2000s."

States as vertices ?\nThe definition of a finite list of states will necessarily be complicated because many contested territories around the world are not recognized by all countries of the world and are therefore difficult to define in terms of geometry and are missing in the databases where the attributes used for regionalization are available.\nMany list of countries are available in open source mapping packages (gadm, natural earth, …) butr with different lists of countries and also different geometry !\n\nTaiwan : the territory is relatively well defined but the country is not present in UN official databases because China consider it as a province of China. But in other databases (e.g. about trade), Taiwan exists.\nNorthern Cyprus : the territory is recognized as a state only by Turkey. The EU consider it as an occupied part of Cyprus.\nAbkhazia, Southern Ossetia, Transnitria, … are de facto states recognized by Russia.\nKosovo : not recognized by all member states of EU\n…\n\n\nWhich geometry of states ?\nAdmitting that we have succeeded in the definition of a finite list of states, another problem will occur concerning the geometry of states which is generally not limited to a single polygon but can generally be defined as a multipolygon which can include very remote pieces of territory. According to the list of pieces of territory that we consider, the network of borders will be different and the results of the regionalization procedure can be heavily modified.\n\n\nLoading required package: terra\n\n\nterra 1.7.46\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'terra'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:cartography':\n\n    north\n\n\n\nThe case of Germany\nGermany is a simple case of state made of a single polygon (if we exclude some islands) and where we can easily propose a list of other states sharing a common terrestrial border : Denmark, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, Austria, Czech republic and Poland. We can of course argue that the list of neighbours has changed during the history of the country but looking at the present situation we can relatively easily define a list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case of Denmark\nThe case of Denmark is a bit more difficult, because we have to decide if Greenland and Faroe islands should be include or not in the territory of the danish state. Both of them are autonomous territories that are more or less remote from the metropolitan area with less population but much more area in the case of Greenland. If we just consider the terrestrial borders, Denmark ha only one neighbor (Germany) and the remote territories does not modify the topology. But the situation will be different if we look at maritim borders with countries like Iceland, Canada, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is exactly the teritory of Denmark ?\n\n\n\n\nLast but not least, we should also consider the case of Sweden which is separated from Denmark by the sea but directly connected to Denmark by the famous bridge of öresund … But as the bridge is achieved by a tunnel, should we consider that the two countries are still separated by the sea …\n\n\n\n\n\nCan we consider that Denmark and Sweden are separated by the sea ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case of France\nAs last example of maximal complexity, we can consider the case of France where we have a lot of rempote territories with a great diversity of political status. Some of them are départements and territoires d’outre mer (DROM) when other are just territoires d’outre mer with different levels of autonomy. Should they be included or not in the list of territories used for the construction of our network ?\n\n\n\n\n\nContrary to Denmark, these remote territories are not only islands and in the case of the territory of Guyane française we have a long terrestrial border with Brazil and Guyana which is also a border of the EU."

It is for example a problem in the case of Malta where the country is not taken into account with a resolution lower than 20km\n\nAccording to our experience, good results in reasonable time can be obtained with a maximum distance of 500 km and a grid of resolution 20km.\nMalta and Cyprus are no more isolated and are connected to neighbours by maritime borders;\n\n\nThe following argument is not relevant when using type = 'typo': col.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nland & sea borders\nA geopolitical network can be elaborated through the combination of land and sea borders :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum distance between states\nThe distance between two states can be measured in different ways. We can use here the interesting work done by CEPII for the analysis of trade flow which suggest as possible solutions :\n\nThe distance between the centroids of the area of each state\nThe distance between the capital cities of each state\nThe average distance between the main cities of each state\n…\n\n\nDistance beteween capital &lt; 500 km\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance between capital &lt; 1000 km"
