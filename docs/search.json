    "text": "Where is Europe?\n\n\nWorldRegio project aims to revisit, from a theoretical and empirical point of view, one of the most fundamental and oldest problems in geography: regionalization. We would like to develop a general theory of the regionalization of a world (abstractly) and then apply it to the trajectories of regionalization of the World (concretely) through time and space. Although rooted in geography, economy, and regional science, this project calls for a dialogue with many other disciplines.\nIn common usage, the term region refers to a portion of space on an intermediate scale between the local and national levels. A regionalization is a division corresponding to the first level of social, spatial, and political organization used below the state. But what about regionalizations of the World, which correspond to a division on an intermediate scale below the global level but above the national level? Faced with a plurality of powers and languages, they are often the source of conflicts of representation or even world wars.\nThe theoretical part of the project aims to understand the difficulties of regionalization of abstract worlds. Different geometries lead to different delimitations of the boundaries of regions, while different languages lead to different semantic qualifications of the content of these regions. Representation conflicts are inevitable if methods are not used to align geometric and semantic concepts.\nApplied to the dynamics of the contemporary world over 20 to 50 years, the empirical part of the project aims to explore the trajectories of regionalization that are transforming the material and imaginary organization of the World. The project proposes to analyze the transformations that are affecting the functional regionalization of the world (trade flows), the imaginaries produced by the media (news flow), and the cognitive representation that actors use according to their social and spatial position (mental maps).\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{grasland2024,\n  author = {Grasland, Claude},\n  title = {WorldRegio},\n  date = {2024-08-31},\n  url = {https://worldregio.github.io/en/posts/2024-08-31-worldregio/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGrasland, Claude. 2024. “WorldRegio.” August 31, 2024. https://worldregio.github.io/en/posts/2024-08-31-worldregio/."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\n\nIn this paper, we will investigate whether or not the name ‘Africa’ can be seen as a slur. Since the name was given by European exploiters, slavers and colonists, it raises the question of whether such a name should continue to be accepted or abandoned. It may seem that just as the slavers renamed their victims and the colonists renamed the territories they conquered, the name Africa/ns similarly was an imposition on the continent and its peoples. It can also be argued that the naming of the continent by an external aggressor is a form of epistemic subordination that vitiates the dignity of the inhabitants. That is to say that European slavers took it upon themselves to give the inhabitants an identity that highlights climate and possibly skin colour because it was something they could not do for themselves. This presents the inhabitants as inferior to their namers and whose millennia-old civilisational achievements can comfortably be overlooked. We argue that the two preceding arguments constitute compelling reasons to abandon the name Africa as a compromised identity and offer an idea for the renaming of the continent."

    "text": "References\nThe two authors follow a postcolonial and critical line of thought, and construct their argument in the form of a dialogue with two main authors:\n\nTsri (2016) serves as the first reference for the idea that attributing the color “black” to the inhabitants of Africa is a racist stereotype that has its origins in the representations that the Greeks and then the Romans forged of the inhabitants of the southern Mediterranean.\nRamose (2003) is the authors’ main reference for criticizing the origin of the word “Africa” and its assignment by Europeans to peoples who had not laid claim to it. Ramose (2003) is the authors’ main reference for criticizing the origin of the word “Africa” and its assignment by Europeans to peoples who had not claimed it. Even if the etymology of the word is debated, it seems to designate “a warm place” (in relation to whom?) whose inhabitants would therefore have “black” skin, the whole constituting a racialized, even slave vision.\n\nIn other words, “the history of ‘Africa’ is primarily the history of the West European experience of ‘Africa’, and only secondarily the history of the continent’s peoples about themselves”. This idea is echoed by Grataloup when he shows that it was Europeans who taught the inhabitants of the southern Mediterranean that they lived on a continent called “Africa” (Grataloup (2009),Grataloup (2011),Grataloup and Capdepuy (2013),Capdepuy (2024)), or in Bopda (2003)’s work on the construction of Cameroon’s national identity."

    "section": "Why rename?",
    "text": "Why rename?\nThe authors identify several arguments in favor of a name change. The two main ones are as follows: -\n\nThe definition of Africa by climate is a historical denial : The authors point out that “by pointing at climate, the European namer silences the history and civilisations of the people. It is as if those people do not exist. The climate-driven name ‘Africa’ can amount to a denial of the people, their existence and contributions to world history and civilisation. This supports our argument that ‘Africa’ can be viewed as a slur, especially in this age of racism, and that the imposition of the name on the continent by Europeans can be interpreted as a form of epistemic subordination of the inhabitants and their cultures.” It’s hard not to recall the unfortunate statement made by a French president in Dakar in 2007, when he declared that “Africa’s tragedy is that the African man has not enough enter in history”1.\nThe right of peoples to self-determination of their name exists at the national level, and must also apply at the continental level: “If we add to the above our earlier discussion on the metaphysical and psychological import of naming, then we would observe that the European naming of a continent and its peoples is an anomaly. No continent or people should have the right to name another. If, for any reason at all, people have been named by another in the past, it is their duty to rename themselves. And this should apply not just to the continent but to countries as well.”. The authors review the countries that have changed their colonial names, such as Rodesia, and criticize those that have not, such as Côte d’Ivoire."

    "title": "Should Africa be renamed?",
    "section": "Anaesia : Land of origins",
    "text": "Anaesia : Land of origins\nThe authors end the article by proposing the word Anaesia from the Ibo language: “Here, we want to propose the name ‘Anaesia’ as a veritable replacement derived from ‘ana and esi’, two words in Igbo-African language that mean ’land or place of origin.’Footnote10 Our case for the abandonment of the name Africa and its replacement with Anaesia is based on two arguments: dignity and epistemic subordination.” The idea is to put Africa back on the map as the “first continent” from which all peoples and civilizations originate, and thus to refute the idea of subordination contained in the word Africa, as well as all the climatic or racial undertones it carried.\nNevertheless, the authors acknowledge some difficulties in choosing the language used to describe this “Land of Origins”. Why choose the Ibo language (the language of Nigeria, from which one of the authors of the article originates) rather than another of the many African languages? The authors dodge the question with what can only be called a pirouette: “Some objections could be raised against our proposal here. Some may question why the entire continent should be named from one of its multiple languages given that the Igbo language is not Africa’s lingua franca. As a result, they may question the possibility of the rest of the continent accessing the Igbo world and the name Anaesia. Others may question our authority to propose a new name for the entire continent. These are legitimate concerns. However, it is important for us to realise that what we are doing is exercise of scholars’ poetic license.”."

But does the solution really lie in changing the word (replacing Africa with Anaesia) or in changing the meaning given to a word? Does the fact that the word Africa inherits a slave etymology condemn its use in the present, given that its meaning has been modified by the sedimentation of usage over the course of history?"

    "text": "A. States as vertices ?\nThe definition of a finite list of states will necessarily be complicated because many contested territories around the world are not recognized by all countries of the world and are therefore difficult to define in terms of geometry and are missing in the databases where the attributes used for regionalization are available.\nMany list of countries are available in open source mapping packages (gadm, natural earth, …) butr with different lists of countries and also different geometry !\n\nTaiwan : the territory is relatively well defined but the country is not present in UN official databases because China consider it as a province of China. But in other databases (e.g. about trade), Taiwan exists.\nNorthern Cyprus : the territory is recognized as a state only by Turkey. The EU consider it as an occupied part of Cyprus.\nAbkhazia, Southern Ossetia, Transnitria, … are de facto states recognized by Russia.\nKosovo : not recognized by all member states of EU\n…\n\n\nWhich geometry of states ?\nAdmitting that we have succeeded in the definition of a finite list of states, another problem will occur concerning the geometry of states which is generally not limited to a single polygon but can generally be defined as a multipolygon which can include very remote pieces of territory. According to the list of pieces of territory that we consider, the network of borders will be different and the results of the regionalization procedure can be heavily modified.\n\n\nLoading required package: terra\n\n\nterra 1.7.46\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'terra'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:cartography':\n\n    north\n\n\n\nThe case of Germany\nGermany is a simple case of state made of a single polygon (if we exclude some islands) and where we can easily propose a list of other states sharing a common terrestrial border : Denmark, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, Austria, Czech republic and Poland. We can of course argue that the list of neighbours has changed during the history of the country but looking at the present situation we can relatively easily define a list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case of Denmark\nThe case of Denmark is a bit more difficult, because we have to decide if Greenland and Faroe islands should be include or not in the territory of the danish state. Both of them are autonomous territories that are more or less remote from the metropolitan area with less population but much more area in the case of Greenland. If we just consider the terrestrial borders, Denmark ha only one neighbor (Germany) and the remote territories does not modify the topology. But the situation will be different if we look at maritim borders with countries like Iceland, Canada, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is exactly the teritory of Denmark ?\n\n\n\n\nLast but not least, we should also consider the case of Sweden which is separated from Denmark by the sea but directly connected to Denmark by the famous bridge of öresund … But as the bridge is achieved by a tunnel, should we consider that the two countries are still separated by the sea …\n\n\n\n\n\nCan we consider that Denmark and Sweden are separated by the sea ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case of France\nAs last example of maximal complexity, we can consider the case of France where we have a lot of rempote territories with a great diversity of political status. Some of them are départements and territoires d’outre mer (DROM) when other are just territoires d’outre mer with different levels of autonomy. Should they be included or not in the list of territories used for the construction of our network ?\n\n\n\n\n\nContrary to Denmark, these remote territories are not only islands and in the case of the territory of Guyane française we have a long terrestrial border with Brazil and Guyana which is also a border of the EU."
