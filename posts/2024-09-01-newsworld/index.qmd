In a recent publication by [The Conversation, 29/08/2024](https://theconversation.com/is-africa-a-racial-slur-and-should-the-continent-be-renamed-234740) it is proposed to rename Africa.

> "Should African people be called black -- or is the categorising of people by skin colour a racist practice? How about Africa? Is the name of the continent a racial slur because it was chosen by European exploiters and based on the weather rather than the people -- and should it be renamed? These are questions that African philosophy scholar Jonathan Okeke Chimakonam considers in a research paper @chimakonam2021"
