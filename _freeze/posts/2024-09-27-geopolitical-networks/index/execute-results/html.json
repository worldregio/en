Among many solutions, the authors often emphasize contiguity, i.e. the presence of a common border:\n\n> \"Whatever the reason for the findings connecting contiguity and conflict, geographic proximity is clearly important factor for empirical analyses of international relations. Several approaches are based on continuous measures of distance between countries. The distance between national capitals (Gleditsch and Singer 1975), or between centers of power (Bueno de Mesquita 1981 ), have been used to as measures of geographic proximity. Gleditsch and Ward (2001) have begun to construct a data set based on the concept of minimum distance, which is simply the distance between the two closest points for a pair of states. Nevertheless, direct contiguity is relatively straightforward and has therefore been, by far, the most common way of measuring proximity.\"[@stinnett2002].\n\nThis is the solution we're going to adopt here, in an attempt to update the database produced by these authors in the early 2000s.\n\n## A. States as vertices ?\n\n\n\nThe definition of a finite list of states will necessarily be complicated because many *contested territories* around the world are not recognized by all countries of the world and are therefore difficult to define in terms of geometry and are missing in the databases where the attributes used for regionalization are available.\n\nMany list of countries are available in open source mapping packages (*gadm*, *natural earth*, ...) butr with different lists of countries and also different geometry !\n\n\n-   **Taiwan** : the territory is relatively well defined but the country is not present in UN official databases because China consider it as a province of China. But in other databases (e.g. about trade), Taiwan exists.\n-   **Northern Cyprus** : the territory is recognized as a state only by Turkey. The EU consider it as an occupied part of Cyprus.\n-   **Abkhazia, Southern Ossetia, Transnitria, ...** are de facto states recognized by Russia.\n-   **Kosovo** : not recognized by all member states of EU\n-   ...\n\n### Which geometry of states ?\n\nAdmitting that we have succeeded in the definition of a finite list of states, another problem will occur concerning the geometry of states which is generally not limited to a single polygon but can generally be defined as a multipolygon which can include very remote pieces of territory. According to the list of pieces of territory that we consider, the network of borders will be different and the results of the regionalization procedure can be heavily modified.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: terra\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nterra 1.7.46\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'terra'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:cartography':\n\n    north\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### The case of Germany\n\nGermany is a simple case of state made of a single polygon (if we exclude some islands) and where we can easily propose a list of other states sharing a common terrestrial border : Denmark, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, Austria, Czech republic and Poland. We can of course argue that the list of neighbours has changed during the history of the country but looking at the present situation we can relatively easily define a list.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=500px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### The case of  Denmark\n\nThe case of Denmark is a bit more difficult, because we have to decide if Greenland and Faroe islands should be include or not in the territory of the danish state. Both of them are autonomous territories that are more or less remote from the metropolitan area with less population but much more area in the case of Greenland. If we just consider the terrestrial borders, Denmark ha only one neighbor (Germany) and the remote territories does not modify the topology. But the situation will be different if we look at maritim borders with countries like Iceland, Canada, etc. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![What is exactly the teritory of Denmark ?](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='left' width=500px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLast but not least, we should also consider the case of Sweden which is separated from Denmark by the sea but directly connected to Denmark by the famous bridge of öresund ... But as the bridge is achieved by a tunnel, should we consider that the two countries are still separated by the sea ...\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Can we consider that Denmark and Sweden are separated by the sea ?](img/oresund.jpg){fig-align='left' width=400px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### The case of France\n\nAs last example of maximal complexity, we can consider the case of France where we have a lot of rempote territories with a great diversity of political status. Some of them are *départements and territoires d'outre mer (DROM)* when other are just *territoires d'outre mer* with different levels of autonomy. Should they be included or not in the list of territories used for the construction of our network ?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nContrary to Denmark, these remote territories are not only islands and in the case of the territory of *Guyane française* we have a long terrestrial border with Brazil and Guyana which is also a border of the EU.\n\n## B. Mediterranean network\n\n\nWe use here the  world map proposed by GADM at low level of resolution and adopt a Robinson projection in order to have distances approximatively in km. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe use the **getBorders()** function from the package *cartography* elaborated by Nicolas Lambert and Timothee Giraud, engineers at UMS RIATE. \n\nWe test firstly the algorithm on a limited sample of countries of 30 countries located in northern and southern shore of the Mediterranea in order to verify the quality of results and the time of computation on 30 countries .\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTime difference of 0.3740909 secs\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe land borders has been correctly extracted. Spain is not related to Morocco because Ceuta and Melila has been eliminated by the level of spatial resolution.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following argument is not relevant when using type = 'typo': col.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Land borders\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n<img src=\"img/network000.png\" width=700px />\n</div>\n\n### Sea borders\n\nThe algortithm elaborated by N. lambert and Timothee Giraud (UMS RIATE) is relatively complex and use two parameters :\n\n- **width** : the maximum distance to land (in meters)\n- **res** : the grid of points used for buffer analysis (in meters). if a unit has no land in the grid, it will not be used for borders analysis. It is for example a problem in the case of Malta where the country is not taken into account with a resolution lower than 20km\n\nAccording to our experience, good results in reasonable time can be obtained with a maximum distance of 500 km and a grid of resolution 20km. \n\n\n::: {.cell waarning='false'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nMalta and Cyprus are no more isolated and are connected to neighbours by maritime borders; \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following argument is not relevant when using type = 'typo': col.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### land & sea borders\n\nA geopolitical network can be elaborated through the combination of land and sea borders :\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n<img src=\"img/network001.png\" width=700px />\n</div>\n\n\n### Minimum distance between states\n\nThe distance between two states can be measured in different ways. We can use here the interesting work done by CEPII for the analysis of trade flow which suggest as possible solutions :\n\n- The distance between the centroids of the area of each state\n- The distance between the capital cities of each state\n- The average distance between the main cities of each state\n- ...\n\n#### Distance beteween capital < 500 km \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n<img src=\"img/network002.png\" width=700px />\n</div>\n\n#### Distance between capital < 1000 km\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n<img src=\"img/network003.png\" width=700px />\n</div>\n\n\n## C. World Network\n\n\nWe propose to elaborate a complete network of world countries based on the GADM siplified map that contains 231 geopolitical units (some of them belonging to the same state) We use the land+sea borders as criteria for the definition of edges. The time of computation was 11 minutes for the sea borders with parameters width= 370 km & res 20 km\n\n\n\n####  World Border Map\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n####  World Border network \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n<img src=\"img/network004.png\" width=700px />\n</div>\n\n\n\nThe centrality of countries in this geopolitical network depends from the number of borders they share with other countries (Cf. China, Iran, Russia, ...)\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n<img src=\"img/network004a.png\" width=700px />\n</div>\n\n\nBut some countries with few links can play a strategig role in the network in terms of betweenness (Cf. USA, Canada, Iceland who connect America with Europe and Asia)\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n<img src=\"img/network004b.png\" width=700px />\n</div>",
