WorldRegio project aims to revisit, from a theoretical and empirical point of view, one of the most fundamental and oldest problems in geography: regionalization. We would like to develop a general theory of the regionalization of a world (abstractly) and then apply it to the trajectories of regionalization of the World (concretely) through time and space.
